# Employee Health and Absenteeism Analysis
## 1-Introduction

Welcome to my portfolio project on analyzing employee health and absenteeism. In this project, we delve into understanding the factors contributing to employee absenteeism and their overall health metrics. The ultimate goal is to assist the HR department in launching campaigns to improve employee health through an annual bonus for the top 100 employees who maintain good health and have absenteeism rates below the average.

## 2-Data Sources
The data comes from 2 csv that HR department have send to us:
- **Absenteeism_at_work:** This dataset contains records of 740 employees, including various attributes such as employee ID, the identificative number of the absence reason, transportation expenses, distance from residence to work, and absenteeism time in hours.
- **Reasons:** This file provides indices and reasons for employee absenteeism
  
## 3-Objectives

1. Analyze employee health data and its correlation with absenteeism rates.
2. Identify seasonal patterns in absenteeism.
3. Classify employees based on health metrics like BMI.
4. Design a Power BI dashboard to visualize the results effectively.
5. Extract the top 100 healthiest employees to compensate their healthy habits with an economical bonus
