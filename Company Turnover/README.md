# Turnover Rate Analysis

## 1-Introduction
Welcome to my portfolio project on employee turnover. Employee turnover can have significant implications for organizations, ranging from financial costs to productivity and morale. Understanding the factors contributing to turnover is crucial for effective management and retention strategies. 

In this project we conduct an in-depth turnover analysis for a model company, by using real data and exploring various demographic and employment-related factors, the project aims to provide insights into the turnover phenomenon and its potential implications for the organization.

## 2-Data
The dataset contains information about 1470 employees, this includes demographic details, job-related factors, such as age, education, job satisfaction, performance rating, and years with the current manager, turnover status among others.

## 3-Objectives

1. **Identify Turnover Causes**: Analyze factors to pinpoint why employees are leaving CompanYX.

2. **Test Hypotheses**: Use statistical methods to explore relationships between employees conditions such as performance and satisfaction.

3. **Compare Turnover Rates**: Calculate company turnover rate and compare it with industry standards, using real data from a report made by Ransdtard on spanish companies turnover in 2022.
   
4. **Measure Actual Turnover Impact:** Calculate wich is the actual economical cost that the company is facing.

5. **Turnover Profiling and Identify Patterns**: Analyze top 3 turnover to both profiles, high-turnover rate and grater turnover costs.

7. **Measure Potential Turnover Impact**: Using the profiling and patterns information, quantify turnover's potential impact on active employees.

## Analysis Process
1. **Data Inspection**: Load and inspected the dataset for any inconsistencies or missing values.
2. **Data Quality Inspection**: Handle duplicated and missing data.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: EDA was conducted to understand the distribution and relationships among variables. Categorical and numerical variables were analyzed separately, also we used visualizations to identify patterns and insights.
4. **Turnover Rate Analysis**: The turnover rate was calculated, and the economic costs associated with turnover were estimated based on a study by the Center for American Progress.
5. **Turnover Profiling**: The analysis identified profiles with the highest turnover rates and associated costs. Top positions and departments were analyzed, and the characteristics of employees likely to leave were explored.

## 5-Insights
1. **Turnover Rate**: The overall turnover rate at Company was found to be below the national average.
2. **Economic Costs**: The overall turnover impact ascends to €2.72M.
3. **Employee Profiles**: We have identified 8 employees who meet these conditions, representing €50,284.13 in potential turnover costs.

## Next Steps
1. **Retention Strategy Development:** Based on insights gained, develop targeted retention strategies for high-turnover roles and departments.
2. **Employee Turnover Prediction:** Use Machine Learning techniques such as classification, to predict turnover for each employee based on their conditions.
