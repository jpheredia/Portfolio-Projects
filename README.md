# Data Analysis - Portfolio Projects

This repository will consist on a series of projects oriented to solve real-world problems, covering the main tasks that a Data Analyst will perform, such as Data Collection, Data Quality and Exploratory Data Analysis to extract insights, drive Hypothesis testing, prepare data to apply machine learning algorithms or create powerful data products such as Dashboards that empower the data-driven decision process.

## Project #1 - Data Analysis for Hotel Management.
Hotels & Hotels a leading Hotel chain wants to know what is the actual revenue situation as the stackeholders are interested in the viability of expanding the parking lots for both the city and resort hotels. To do this we will use SQL to inspect and create the final query that we will use to create a dashboard in Power BI. This dashboard, will visualize data about the main KPIs, the revenue and its evolution and also check the feasibility of the expansion of the parking lots for both hotels.

## Project #2 - Customer Segmentation
We work in the retail sector, where our marketing team is planning to launch targeted campaigns. In this case, we have to perform a segmentation of shopping mall customers, to do so, we will use Python and Machine Learning algorithms to decide the target customers to be addressed by the campaign.

## Project #3 - Absentism at work
Due to the increase in absenteeism, this year our company wants to reward healthy colleagues to encourage employees to adopt healthier habits. In this project we use SQL to inspect the data and Power BI to visualize the overall health status of the company, habits and reasons for absenteeism by groups.

## Project #4 - Employee Turnover
The job market is experiencing an increase in employee turnover, our company is not effectively dealing with this problem today, so we are tasked to try to minimize this problem. For this project, we will perform an in-depth analysis using Python, we will face real data problems such as missing data, and we will use real world data in order to quantify and establish a baseline for the improvement of this problem.
